# DISCRIPTION : 
Flask is used to create the backend server that handles HTTP API requests, routing, and client connections, while SocketIO is layered on top of Flask to establish persistent WebSocket connections. Unlike traditional request-response models where the client must repeatedly ask the server for new data (polling), SocketIO enables bidirectional communication, meaning the server can push messages to the client instantly. This is exactly how real chat platforms like WhatsApp Web, Instagram Chat, Discord, and Telegram Web function under the hood — they maintain a live connection to send and receive messages in real time. SocketIO also includes support for fallback transports, rooms, events, broadcasting, and reconnection, making it ideal for chat applications.

API Integration in the Chat App

In addition to real-time messaging, this project also includes API integration to fetch and manage supporting data like user details, chat history, or message logs (if implemented). The React frontend can make API calls using fetch() or Axios to interact with Flask routes such as:
Fetching chat history from the server
Registering or identifying users when they join
Sending messages through API endpoints (optional extension)
Validating server status


How to Run :  
npm install
npm run dev
